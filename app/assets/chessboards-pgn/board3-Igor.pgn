{This was the only ocassion during my Bundesliga career when I only played a
single game on a double-round weekend. That was due to a canceled flight. My
opponent was really surprised to see me showing up :)} 1. Nf3 c5 (1... d5 {
was more likely to happen.}) 2. b3 $5 {I borrowed this "anti-fianchetto" idea
from Kramnik. He won a spectacular game against Jones, and he also had
advantage in his encounter with Gelfand. I prepared this line especially for
this game.} b6 {A real suprise. 2...d5 and 2...Nc6 are the usual moves.} ({
One of my intented lines:} 2... d5 3. e3 (3. Bb2 f6 4. e4 $5 dxe4 5. Nh4 {
leads to wild complications.}) 3... Nc6 4. Bb2 Nf6 5. g3 $5 (5. Bb5) 5... e6 6.
Bg2 Be7 7. O-O O-O 8. c4 {and we transposed into a normal reversed-benoni type
of position.}) 3. Bb2 Bb7 4. g3 Nf6 5. Bg2 g6 $5 {Strategically speaking a
risky decision.} (5... e6 {is the normal way to play.}) 6. Bxf6 $5 {I took the
oppurtunity to change the charachter of the game. I give up the bishop pair in
order to ruin black's pawn structure, and after 7.c4 I'm trying to secure an
outpost on d5 square to my minor pieces.} exf6 7. c4 $1 f5 (7... d5 {would
have been the best.} 8. Nh4 (8. cxd5 Bxd5 9. Nc3 Bb7) 8... Qd7 9. Nc3 dxc4 10.
bxc4 (10. Bxb7 Qxb7 11. O-O cxb3) 10... Nc6 $1 $13 {is ok according to the
computer.}) 8. Nc3 Bg7 9. Rc1 Nc6 10. O-O O-O {Normal developing moves.} 11.
Ne1 (11. e3 {was an alternative.}) 11... a6 12. Nd3 $1 {The N is heading for
d5 via a bit unusual squares.} Rb8 13. Nf4 d6 14. e3 Re8 15. Nfd5 $14 {I
managed to reach my strategic goal.} Ba8 (15... Bc8 {may have been my choice
with black pieces, but it doesn't solve the main problems.} 16. Nf6+ Bxf6 17.
Bxc6 Rf8 18. Nd5) (15... Bxc3 16. Rxc3 Nb4 (16... Kg7 17. Qa1) 17. Nxb4 cxb4
18. Rd3 $14) 16. a4 $1 {Not allowing any counterplay!} Qd7 17. Qc2 Ne5 (17...
a5 $5 {is reasonable to block the entire queenside.}) 18. Rb1 Bc6 {
Weird-looking move allowing me to seize the initiative in this relatively calm
position.} 19. f4 $1 (19. h3 {was also interesting with the intention of: 20.
f4 Bxd5 21.cxd5! trapping my opponent's active knight.}) 19... Bxd5 (19... Ng4
20. h3 $5 (20. b4) 20... Nf6 (20... Bxd5 21. Nxd5 Nf6 22. b4 $14) 21. Nxf6+
Bxf6 22. Bxc6 Qxc6 23. Nd5 {The difference between the two minor pieces is
quite visible.} Bg7 24. g4 $5 {This can be prepared, but there's nothing wrong
with this immediate push.} fxg4 25. hxg4 Qd7 26. f5 $36) 20. Nxd5 Nc6 21. b4 $1
Ne7 $6 (21... a5 {would have been Khenkin's best bet.} 22. bxc5 bxc5 23. Rb5
Nb4 24. Qb3 Qa7 $14) (21... cxb4 22. Nxb4 Nxb4 23. Rxb4 $16) 22. bxc5 bxc5 (
22... Nxd5 23. c6 $1 {Very important "zwischenzug"!} Qxc6 24. Bxd5 Qc5 25. g4
$1 {The computer attacks immediately!} (25. Qb3 Qa5 26. Qb4) (25. Rb3 Qa5 26.
Rfb1 Qxa4 27. Qc1) 25... fxg4 26. f5 $16) 23. Nb6 $1 $16 {I'm very proud of
this move. White temporarily closes the only open file in order to gain time
for his heavy pieces to enter the battle, while avoiding unnecessary exchanges.
Black has no counterplay.} Qc7 24. a5 Bf6 $6 {Final mistake but it's hard to
give good advice here.} ({After} 24... Nc6 25. Bxc6 Qxc6 26. Nd5 {Rb6 is
coming!}) 25. Qa4 $1 Rbd8 (25... Kg7 26. Nd7 $1 Rxb1 27. Rxb1 $18) (25... Red8
26. Nd7 Rxb1 27. Nxf6+ Kg7 28. Rxb1 Kxf6 29. Qa1+ Ke6 30. Rb7 Qc8 31. Qg7 $18)
26. Nd5 $1 $18 {Simple and strong. Black's queenside is about to fall. The
appereance of the opposite coloured bishops help the attacker when heavy
pieces on the board, old principle in chess.} Nxd5 27. Bxd5 Re7 (27... Rb8 28.
Rb6 (28. Rb7 {winning an exchange, but Rb6 is even stronger.})) 28. Rb6 h5 29.
Rfb1 Qc8 30. Rc6 Qd7 31. Rbb6 {The game is practically over, but in my
opponent's timetrouble I didn't really take seriously his counterplay, so he
could create some "threats".} h4 32. Qb3 Kg7 33. Rxa6 g5 34. Rab6 hxg3 35. hxg3
gxf4 36. gxf4 Qe8 37. Rxd6 Rxd6 38. Rxd6 Bd4 $5 39. Bf3 $6 (39. Qd3 {The
Houdini is not scared of ghosts...} Bxe3+ 40. dxe3 Rxe3 41. Qxf5 Re1+ 42. Kh2
Qe2+ 43. Bg2 {was the simplest.}) 39... Qh8 40. Qd1 $6 (40. Kg2 Re8 41. exd4
Re1 42. Kg3 $1 {Chess is pretty easy with the help of our silicon friends :).}
Rg1+ 43. Bg2) 40... Qh4 (40... Qb8 {better is:} 41. Rd5 Qxf4 42. exd4 {but he
is lost anyway,}) 41. Kg2 $1 {This was the point of my overcautious play.} Rxe3
(41... Bf6 42. Qh1) (41... Bxe3 42. dxe3 Rxe3 43. a6 $1 Re1 44. Qxe1 $1 Qxe1
45. a7 $18 {Nice knock-out line.}) 42. dxe3 Bxe3 43. Qa1+ $1 {This was the
most convincing way to end the game at once.} Kg8 (43... Kh7 44. Qh1) (43...
Kf8 {would have allowed me to finish the game in style:} 44. Qh8+ $1 Qxh8 45.
Rd8+ Kg7 46. Rxh8 Kxh8 47. a6 {and the a pawn cannot be stopped.}) 44. Qh1 $1 {
The white queen uses three of the corners, rare situation :)} Qf2+ 45. Kh3 Bxf4
46. Rd8+ Kh7 47. Qg2 {black resigned, in view of the inevitable exchange of
the queens or mate.} 1-0
