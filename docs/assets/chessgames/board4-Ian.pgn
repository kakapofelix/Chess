{Round 4, Russia-Hungary! One of the most decisive rounds came very early. We
were ready to cause as many problems to our opponents as possible.} 1. Nf3 {
My opponent is a well-known gruenfeld expert, that day I wasn't ready to test
his knowledge there. Instead I went for something less forcing since I was
intending to play some calm positional chess instead of wild complications.} c5
2. c4 Nf6 3. Nc3 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e3 $5 {The first time I opted for this
line in this move order. Previously I had played 5.Qa4 and 5.e4.} Nxc3 (5... e6
{is the most solid.}) 6. dxc3 $5 {An old favourite of Ulf Andersson. This
harmless-looking line has recently been rediscovered. In comparison with 5.e4
Nxc3?! (...Nb4 is critical) 6.dxc3 white looses an important tempo, but white
players claim that the arising structure slightly favours white anyways so it
still make sense to enter this line with a tempo down and what's more, to play
for a real advantage!} (6. bxc3 g6 7. h4 {or 7.Bb5 are more aggressive tries.})
6... Qxd1+ ({To me} 6... Qc7 {is a bit more logical, the queen is active here,
and the position is less dry. During the world cup Bu Xiangzhi couldn't pose
problems to Svidler in this line.} 7. e4 Nc6 8. Qd2 $5 {was my intended
novelty, white can still press a little here.}) 7. Kxd1 b6 $5 (7... Nc6 {
is the most popular here.} 8. e4 b6 9. Kc2 Bb7 10. Be3 e6 11. Nd2 Bd6 12. a4
Ke7 (12... O-O-O 13. f3 Bc7 {Would have been more reliable, with the idea to
meet 14.Nc4 with f5!}) 13. f3 Ne5 14. a5 h6 15. h4 Bc6 16. h5 Nd7 17. Nc4 Bc7

2017}) (7... Bf5 8. Nd2 $1 Nc6 9. e4 Be6 $6 (9... Bg6) 10. Kc2 g6 11. Bc4 Bd7
12. Nb3 b6 13. a4 $36 {Radjabov - Svidler, Geneva 2017}) 8. Bb5+ $146 {
Nepomniachtchi faced 8.e4 in 2016. 8.Ne5 can also be tried. White is happy to
trade-off the bishops, since it makes the light squares more vulnerable in
black's camp.} Bd7 9. a4 a6 {Weakens some squares, but forcing white to make a
decision.} (9... Nc6 10. e4 f6 11. Kc2 O-O-O 12. Be3 e5 13. Nd2 Kc7 14. f3 $14
{Was one line I had looked at before the game.}) 10. Bxd7+ {10.Bd3 was
sensible too.} Nxd7 11. e4 e6 12. Bf4 $1 {Black was ready to develop by means
of ...Bd6, Ke7 and the if necessary the bishop can drop back to c7. This ideal
setup was to be avoided.} f6 $6 {A commital move. My opponent thought that his
king belongs to e6, it proved to be wrong.} ({I was expecting something like:} 
12... Be7 13. Ke2 (13. Kc2 O-O-O 14. Rhd1) 13... O-O-O 14. Rhd1 Kb7 {but it
turns out, that the black king cannot reach the optimal c6 square and faces
concret problems here too:} (14... f6 $142 15. Nd2 e5 16. Bg3 Kb7 17. Nc4 Kc6
18. Ne3 $36) 15. a5 $1 (15. Rxd7+ $2 {doesn't work at all:} Rxd7 16. Ne5 Rdd8
$1 17. Nxf7 Rdf8 $1 $19) 15... b5 16. Bd6 $1 Rhe8 17. Bxe7 Rxe7 18. Rd6 $1 $16
{White has a serious initative!}) 13. Nd2 {Around here I started to believe
that I can win this game.} Be7 $6 (13... O-O-O {was still not too bad.}) 14.
Nc4 Kf7 15. Kc2 e5 16. Rhd1 $1 {Forcing the K to e6, where he becomes a target.
} Ke6 17. Be3 $16 {Now it turned out, that black is suffering. Lacks active
plan, and barely keeps his position together.} Rhb8 {Passive but best.} (17...
Rhd8 $2 {was not an option} 18. Rxd7 Rxd7 19. Nxb6 {wins a pawn.}) ({After}

too.}) 18... axb5 19. Na3 $5 {was what I liked most:} Rab8 (19... Rhb8 $2 20.

would drop a piece:} 19. f5+ gxf5 20. exf5+ Kxf5 21. Rxd7 $18) 19. Bxf4 Rb7 20.
Rd5 {Right here, I had a very nice, harmonious position. White is absolutely
dominating, but to win is never an easy task.} Raa7 {Rock-solid move, securing
7th rank.} 21. Nd6 ({According to the computer} 21. Rad1 b5 22. Nd6 Bxd6 23.
Rxd6+ Ke7 24. a5 $1 {was the precise play. Black hardly can make a move, one
of his pawns (a6 or c5) is likely to drop. White intends to play 25.Rc6 and
then 26.Rdd6.} Ra8 (24... Nf8 25. e5 Ne6 26. exf6+ $18) 25. Rc6 Kf7 $1 26. Rdd6

transposes to 21.Rad1}) 24. Rxa5 Rb5 25. Raxa6 Rab7 26. Ra2 Nb6 $16) 23... Ra8
(23... a5 {would have been more stubborn according to Stockfish. However it
has an obvious drawback such as weakening vital light squares (c4-b5) which
can be used by white king and also loosing time, so white can go for 24.Re1
and e5 next.} 24. Re1 (24. Kd3 $5) (24. Kb3 b5 25. Bd6+ Kf7 26. Bxc5 $2 bxa4+ (

Kc2 since 26.Bxc5 allows the sudden resource Ra6 allowing black to come back!})

defender.}) (23... Ne5 24. Bxe5 fxe5 25. a5 $18) (23... Nb8 24. Rc8 $1 (24.

collecting material, instead I went for dominancy again!} (26. Rxb6 Nxb6 27.

Makes my job simpler. The king doesn't secure the d6 square, which I can use
to my benefit.} (26... Ke6 27. Rd1 Rd8 {At this point my plan was to play 28.
e5 with the intention to meet fxe5 with 29.Bg5, but it turns out that white
has a better way to force resignation.} (27... Ne5 28. Rxc5 $18) 28. b4 $3 cxb4

material. It was found by young hungarian kids during my training session.} Rb4

material is equal for the moment. This would have been a better try since my
time trouble was approaching.}) 27. Rd1 Rd8 28. Rd6 (28. Bd6 {is at least as
good.}) 28... g5 $5 {Tricky.} 29. Bg3 {Just relax.} (29. Rcxd7 Rxd7 30. Rxb6

white also remained in the driving seat.} Kf7 33. Rd5 $1 Re8 34. Kd3 h4 35. b4

to reach time control without changing anything in the position.} Rb6 41. g4 $1

too late to go wrong. The greedy} 43. Kc5 $4 {lets the win slip away...} Rb5+

dirty trick!} 46. gxf5 g4 {and the h pawn is a queen!}) 43... Rc6 (43... Re6

keeps his pawn while collecting the kingside as well. I like giving absolutely
no chance to the opponents if it's possible. It was the case this time.} a5 47.

kept me sitting there for another half an hour, but finally he resigned :).

match!} 1-0
